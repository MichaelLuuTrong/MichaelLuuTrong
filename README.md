Hi! 

My name is Michael Luu-Trong, and I'm a full-stack software developer from Southern California.

I build responsive and performant web applications. I have a background in biology, but I have been drawn to the problem-solving nature of programming for a long time. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed me further to explore software engineering as a career path, and I made the switch as my passion for software development grew.
